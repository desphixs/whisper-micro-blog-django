# We import path and include from django.urls.

# include: used to reference other local app urls.py files, keeping routing modular.

# REAL-WORLD ANALOGY: The Central Information Desk
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Imagine the main `urls.py` is the chief receptionist standing at the front door 
# of the Django tower. 
# 
# When a visitor walks in and asks to visit "/admin/", the chief receptionist 
# handles it directly by pointing them to Django's built-in admin room.
# 
# But when a visitor asks for anything else (like "/register/"), the receptionist
# doesn't know every single private desk layout. Instead, they look at the rule:
# `path('', include('accounts.urls'))`
# 
# This rule tells the receptionist: "For any standard site traffic, hand the visitor's
# map over to the Accounts Department receptionist (accounts.urls) and let them guide
# the visitor to the final desk!"
# ==============================================================================

# We define the master list of URL paths for the entire website.
urlpatterns = [
    # Routes any requests starting with 'admin/' directly to the Django Admin backend.
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    # We include our accounts app urls.py. By passing an empty string '' as the prefix,
    # we allow routes defined in accounts/urls.py (like 'register/') to be accessed
    # directly at the root level (e.g., 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/register/').
    path('', include('accounts.urls')),
